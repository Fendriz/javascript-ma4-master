1.	DOM stand for the Document Object Model and is a programming interface for html documents. The DOM represent the document with nodes and objects that can be modified
	with a scripting language like JavaScript.

2.	.querySelector()
	.createElement()
	.appendChild()

3. 	A asynchronous call is a call that is done in a different order then how they are listed in the program. In JavaScript this can be done with a callback function.
   	because of the structure of JavaScript (how the call stack and event loop is working) the callback functions are being held in a separate queue then the non-callback functions. The non-callback function has a "VIP" pass over the callback functions.

4. 	The source tab in chrome dev tools has 3 different parts.

	-	The file navigator where all the files for the site are located.
	-	The Code Editor where the content of the files is displayed.
	-	The JavaScript Debugging pane where you have various tools you can use to debug the page's JavaScript
			- 	add in breakpoints
			- 	step through code:
			-	step into function call
			-	step over next functional
			etc....

5. 	Since you can end up in an "anti-pattern" that is named "callback hell", you can use a JavaScript promise. A "callback hell» is a callback pattern where you have
	callbacks inside other callbacks. In cases where you need to have a request based on another request you need to have this. Here you also need to write out error code for each function. This structure can be a bit messy and a promise can be a better choice.

	A promise is an object that wraps an asynchronous  operation and notifies when it's done. Instead of providing a callback it has its own method "then" for when a 	successful result is available and a catch for when something went wrong.


6. 	An API is a set of rules for interacting with a webserver. It’s used to describe a kind of web interface. API's responds with data in a raw format that needs to be
	"parsed" by a programming language. JSON and XML are the most common formats for this.

7. 	A event in JavaScript can be attached to specific items like a button, a paragraph, a div, the whole document. This event can be accessed by an event handler which is a
	block of code that will run when the event fires.

8.  Event bubbling is a way of capturing how an event is propagating though the DOM. In the specific case of bubbling the event is first handled an captured by the inner
	element and then "bubbling" to the outermost element.
